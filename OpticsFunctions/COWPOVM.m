%% Bob's Flag-State Squashed POVM for COW protocol in <=N subspace
% See for e.g.- Fig. 1 from 10.1088/1367-2630/ac1e41 for a schematic of the optical detection setup.
% Input:
% * N   : photon number corresponding to unsquashed <=N-photon subspace
% 
% * n   : number of bits in a block. For 3-State Protocol, this can be set to 1.
% 
% * t   : fraction of photons going into the monitoring line. For DPS, this
% can be set to 1.
% 
% Output:
% * POVM : a cell of the POVM elements

    % This projector takes a vector in the bigger space (of <= N photon in
    % EACH mode). If there are > N photon total, it produces zero. If there
    % are <=N photon total, it leaves it unchanged. We will construct this
    % project as follows.
