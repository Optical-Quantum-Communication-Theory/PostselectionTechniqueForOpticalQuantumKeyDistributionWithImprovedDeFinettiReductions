%% Bob's observed detection statistics for the 3-state protocol with a loss-only channel
%
% We assume that we have a loss-only channel and so whenever Alice sends
% coherent states, Bob receives coherent states with a reduced amplitude.
% Alice sends the state |mu, 0> with probability q/2, |0, mu> with
% probability q/2, |mu/sqrt(2), mu/sqrt(2)> with probability (1-q). After channel loss, the
% states going into Bob's apparatus will be essentially the same as what
% Alice sends except with mu replaced with alpha, the amplitude of the
% coherent state after loss.
%
% Input:
% * alpha   : Amplitude of the coherent states entering Bob's apparatus.
% 
% * q       : Probability of Alice sending a state in the key map basis.
%             Further details given above.
%
% * t       : Fraction of photons going into the monitoring line.
%
% Output:
% * p : Cell containing all the probabilities corresponding to the
%       different POVM elements.
%
% * pzeroalpha : Cell containing the probabilities corresponding to the
%                different POVM elements conditioned on Alice having sent 
%                the zeroalpha state.
%
% * palphazero : Cell containing the probabilities corresponding to the
%                different POVM elements conditioned on Alice having sent 
%                the zeroalpha state.
%
% * palphaalpha : Cell containing the probabilities corresponding to the
%                different POVM elements conditioned on Alice having sent 
%                the decoy (alphaalpha) state.
