%% Calculate the minimum weight of the <=N-photon subspace of the signal state of Three State Protocol
% Input:
% * N  : number of photons 
% * t  : fraction of photons going into the monitoring line
% * pbx: Bob's outcome probability cell conditioned on Alice choice of
%        state where x = 2 indicates her sending the "+" state
%
% Output:
% * PleqN: probability of signal state in <=N-photon subspace
