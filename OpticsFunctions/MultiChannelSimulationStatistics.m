%% Bob's observed detection statistics for the 3-state protocol with a loss-only channel
%
% We assume that we have a loss-only channel and so whenever Alice sends
% coherent states, Bob receives coherent states with a reduced amplitude.
% Alice sends the state |mu, 0> with probability q/2, |0, mu> with
% probability q/2, |mu, mu> with probability 1-q. After channel loss, the
% states going into Bob's apparatus will be essentially the same as what
% Alice sends except with mu replaced with alpha, the amplitude of the
% coherent state after loss.
%
% Input:
% * p : Cell containing all the probabilities corresponding to the
%       different POVM elements as outputted by ChannelSimulationStatistics.
%
% * pzeroalpha : Cell containing the probabilities corresponding to the
%                different POVM elements conditioned on Alice having sent 
%                the zeroalpha state as outputted by ChannelSimulationStatistics.
%
% * palphazero : Cell containing the probabilities corresponding to the
%                different POVM elements conditioned on Alice having sent 
%                the zeroalpha state as outputted by ChannelSimulationStatistics.
%
% * palphaalpha : Cell containing the probabilities corresponding to the
%                different POVM elements conditioned on Alice having sent 
%                the decoy (alphaalpha) state as outputted by ChannelSimulationStatistics.
%
% Output:
% * P : Vector containing all the probabilities corresponding to the
%       different coarse grained POVM elements.
%
% * Pzeroalpha : Vector containing the probabilities corresponding to the
%                different coarse grained POVM elements conditioned on Alice having sent 
%                the zeroalpha state.
%
% * Palphazero : Vector containing the probabilities corresponding to the
%                different coarse grained POVM elements conditioned on Alice having sent 
%                the zeroalpha state.
%
% * Palphaalpha : Vector containing the probabilities corresponding to the
%                different coarse grained POVM elements conditioned on Alice having sent 
%                the decoy (alphaalpha) state.
