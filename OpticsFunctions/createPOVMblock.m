 %% Forming the POVM from a specified set of annihilation operators assuming Nphoton photons
% 

% We are given as input the following : 
% Input:
% * indices   : Vector of numbers that signify the indices for the previous
%         summations. This stores the number of photons you have already
%         put in the first few detectors. We start with {0}. 
%         

% * annOp   : Cell containing all the annihilation operators for the different
%         detectors and time slots.

% * NPhoton   : Total number of photons that are detected.
%
% * vac : The vacuum state |0>.


% We have to sum over all  photon numbers for the different modes with the 
% constraint that the sum of all the photon numbers in
% the modes is NPhoton. Thus, we have multiple summations that are dependent
% on each other through the constraint. This function is recursive.
%
% We will first populate the first modes with some number of photons.
% Now we have to populate the remaining modes with a smaller number of
% photons. Thus, this function can be called recursively, until we only
% have a single modes left. In this case, ALL the remaining photons must go
% into that mode.
% 
%
% This code can be used to find multi-click POVM elements for any protocol
% if you know the annihilation operators for each detector.



% Output:
% * P : a (2n,1) cell which will be the POVMs after adding the contribution
%       due to the detector and time-slot represented by the annihilation
%       operator m
